Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more…

Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life we'll always go on
