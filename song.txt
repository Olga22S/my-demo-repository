Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once moreâ€¦

Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life we'll always go on
